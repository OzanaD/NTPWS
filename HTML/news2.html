			<h2>Ziwadi's progress in our care</h2>
			<p>Ziwadi has overcome the hurdles put in her path thanks to the dedicated care of our Keepers and her own quiet determination.</p>
			<p>Six months ago, we received reports of an abandoned calf on the Maasai Mara. She was so desperate for company that she was shadowing passing herdsmen and their 
				livestock, which left the local villagers very fearful.
			</p>
			<p>Already one arrow had been shot at her, so at the request of the Kenya Wildlife Service we set plans in motion to rescue her. 
				Ziwadi's first months at the Nursery were fraught; she was plagued by health issues, from temporary blindness to periodic seizures, and we can only imagine 
				the psychological trauma she endured before we got to her.
			</p>
			<p>She continues to recover well while we share an update on this brave girl's progress.</p>
			<p>Ziwadi has also found some new friends while she is recovering, with whom she enjoys playing and having fun.</p>
