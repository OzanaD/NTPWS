			<h2><b>Main goal --> Elephant protection!</b></h2>
			<p>Elephant Trust is an international non–profit organization dedicated to providing care and assistance to African and Asian captive elephant population 
				through a multifaceted approach involving local community outreach, rescue and rehabilitation programs, donations and educational ecotourism operations.
			</p>
			<p>Our work creates many projects which include anti-poaching, safe guarding the natural environment, enhancing community awareness, addressing animal welfare issues, 
				providing veterinary assistance to animals in need, rescuing and hand rearing elephant orphans, along with other species that can ultimately enjoy a quality of 
				life in wild terms when grown.
			</p>
			<p>Working alongside other organisations and local communities our multifaceted approach to conservation is underpinned by our collaboration 
				with local communities bordering African and Asian National Parks. Working alongside Afriacan and Asian local people is paramount in securing a safe and bright future for both wildlife, humans 
				and reducing human-wildlife conflict.
			</p>
			<p>At Elephant Trust, we believe elephants are of considerable economic, ecological, cultural and aesthetic value to many people in the world and are one of Africa’s and Asia's most valuable wildlife 
				species. They are the flagships, providing motivation for raising awareness, stimulating action, encouraging funding for conservation efforts, and generating opportunities to 
				reconsider the boundaries between conservation and rural development. Our vision, to open borders for Africa’s and Asia's wildlife through education and research will help 
				ensure future generations share their lives with these great giants.
