			<h2>The UK ivory bill received Royal Assent and became law!</h2>
			<p>The UK Ivory Law is one of the world's toughest bans on ivory trade, and, with some narrow exemptions, will bring an end to the ivory trade in the UK.</p>
			<p>As the largest exporter of ivory in the EU, as well as allowing a thriving legal ivory trade at home, the UK plays a major role in feeding consumer demand for ivory. 
				This makes the UK a complicit player in the ongoing poaching that is driving elephants to extinction in the wild.
			</p>
			<p>The government pledged in two election manifestos - in 2010 and 2015 - to bring about the complete closure of the UK’s domestic ivory market.  
				In September 2017 it said it would announce a consultation in the new year, but that never materialized. Finally, on 6 October 2017, the government announced a proposal for a 
				total ban on ivory sales in the UK, to be preceded by a 12-week consultation to allow all interested parties to take part in the process.
			</p>
			<p>The facts are inarguable: any legal trade in ivory perpetuates the illegal trade and poaching, and if elephants are to survive and come back from the worst sustained 
				killing of a species in history, the closure of ALL ivory markets globally is a critical and urgent step.
			</p>
			<p>Elephant Trust has been the leading grassroots group in the UK fighting for a ban on the ivory trade. 
				Since 2015 we have held numerous protests on the street, at auction houses, outside DEFRA, Downing St and Parliament, and have written open letters to 2 prime 
				ministers. We enthusiastically welcome this ban that’s been such a long time coming, and look forward to its speedy and full implementation in 2018.
