			<h1>Elephant Endangerment</h1>
			<h2>Why are elephants endangered?</h2>
			<figure>
				<img src="img/slon_odlomak.jpg">
				<figcaption>Elephants are the largest existing land animals. 
							Three species are currently recognised: the African bush elephant, the African forest elephant, and the Asian elephant.  
							Distinctive features of all elephants include a long trunk, tusks, large ear flaps, massive legs, and tough but sensitive skin..

			<p>There is no more iconic symbol of wildlife conservation than the noble elephant that marches the plains of Africa and the jungles of Asia. 
				However, while the elephant is admired everywhere for its intelligence and emotional complexity, it is under assault from all sides and is tragically facing extinction.
			</p>
			<p>In Africa and Asia elephants are being poached for their tusks in unprecedented numbers, simply to satisfy consumer demand for ivory trinkets. 
				If they’re not being poached, elephants all over the world are suffering horrific cruelty and abuse in captivity. At most elephant camps catering to tourists, elephants give rides, perform in shows, and paint pictures. 
				All of this they learned by being abused and forced to do the same repetitive routine each day. 
				They have wounds and scars from years of abuse, are often dehydrated, underfed, over-worked, tired, suffer physical and psychological trauma, and when not working, 
				they are chained and deprived of natural behaviours and social interaction with other elephants. Humanity has destroyed them – now it’s up to humanity to save them.
			</p>
			<p>Elephant Trust is a charitable organization dedicated to protecting elephants from abuse, danger and extinction. 
				Our mission is to secure a future for elephants and to sustain the beauty and ecological integrity of the places they live; to promote man’s delight in their intelligence
				and the diversity of their world, and to develop a tolerant relationship between the two species. We work with wildlife departments, protected area managers and communities to 
				assist their efforts to defend elephants against ivory poachers and traffickers. We develop and deploy cutting edge tracking systems to monitor and protect elephants.
			</p> 
			<p><b>YOU CAN HELP US SAVE THE ELEPHANTS NOW!</b> If you love elephants donate to our trust and help the elephants by providing them with food, medical care and shelter. 
				Or at least if you are planning a holiday that includes an elephant experience, please do your research and make it cruelty-free.
