			<h2>Tanzania, once Africa's elephant graveyard, takes fight to poachers</h2>
			<p>It is a sight that has made Tanzania’s savannah a Mecca for wildlife tourists. When the sun had climbed high enough to warm their backs, four dark grey shapes 
				lumbered leisurely out of a thicket and began, without much urgency, to graze.
			</p>
			<p>But this family of elephants is lucky to be alive — survivors of what has been described as one of the most catastrophic poaching sprees in history. 
				“If they were from the Selous reserve, they’d keep their distance and they’d be quite aggressive,” said Raymond, a guide. 
				“There they have learnt that humans are dangerous.”
			</p>
			<p>Tens of thousands of elephants have been killed over the past decade, as rising wealth in China and East Asia created new customers for luxury ivory items.</p>
			<p>The crisis, exacerbated by a transnational network of organised crime and corruption, affects almost every African country with an elephant population and will be 
				the subject of an international summit hosted by the Duke of Cambridge in London next month.
			</p>
			<p>This week Prince William visited the port of Dar es Salaam and Tanzania’s ivory stockpile to raise awareness ahead of the conference. 
				A slew of initiatives will be announced, including a commitment by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to sign up to an intelligence 
				sharing initiative championed by the Duke. Eighteen African countries will present their own plans to tackle the crisis and lobby for Western funding.
			</p>
			<p>It is an immensely complex task made no easier by rancorous divisions between conservationists, campaigners, and governments over issues like licensed hunting, 
				law enforcement and whether to destroy, store or sell the ivory stockpiles most governments maintain. A typical dispute erupted earlier this month, 
				when Elephants Without Borders, an NGO, reported an alarming increase in sightings of elephant carcasses in Botswana, which is home to more elephants than 
				any other country in Africa and has previously been considered relatively safe from poaching. The government hit back angrily, arguing the methodology was flawed, 
				there was no evidence they had all died recently and that the numbers reported were not inconsistent with the natural rate of death.
